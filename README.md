## 🎥 Demos & Resources

- [Screen Reader Walkthrough – What You Don’t See Hurts Everyone](https://youtu.be/9EVDTUl0fA4)  
  Most people have no idea how a screen reader works—so how can they be expected to design for blind users? I made this demo because when sighted designers *see* how I navigate, it reframes how they think about UX. This short walkthrough flips the switch for teams struggling to understand real accessibility.

## 🧠 How I Work

Accessibility has to be baked in from the beginning—otherwise it becomes exponentially harder to retrofit later.

I start by collaborating with product managers to help them balance accessibility with business priorities, user needs, and timelines. Then I stay involved across every phase of the process:

- I consult with designers and encourage accessibility annotations so developers aren’t left guessing.
- I work directly with devs to troubleshoot complex implementation issues and untangle tricky UI logic.
- I aim for MVPs to be usable—maybe not perfect, but built on solid, accessible foundations.

In one project, I collaborated with a visual designer to overhaul a benefits application form. She described the layout visually, and I walked her through the full user flow. We improved contrast and spacing for users with low vision and attention differences, clarified the structure for users who are easily distracted, and implemented semantic markup and proper form labeling to support screen reader navigation.  
The result? People were able to apply more quickly and independently—with fewer support requests and drop-offs.

## 📄 Case Studies
- [Redesigning a Benefits Application Form for Accessibility](#)  
Collaborated with a visual designer to overhaul a benefits application form. I walked through the entire flow as a blind user, identifying friction points and flagging structural barriers. We implemented semantic markup, clarified language, improved spacing, and created a smoother path for low vision users and people under cognitive load. The redesign led to fewer support tickets and more successful submissions—especially from those who previously struggled.

## 👤 About Me

I’m Angela Fowler—a product designer, accessibility strategist, and systems thinker who believes good design starts by asking better questions.

I’ve been blind all my life, so accessibility isn’t theoretical—it’s personal. But that’s not why people hire me. They hire me because I translate messy, inaccessible systems into clear, usable experiences that serve real people. Because I know how to work across disciplines—from design to engineering to leadership—and because I don’t treat accessibility like an afterthought or a compliance checklist. It’s baked into how I solve problems.

Over the years, I’ve:
- Transformed federal agency workflows through accessibility coaching and audit work  
- Led accessibility office hours that changed company culture, not just compliance rates  
- Helped designers and devs build usable, accessible tools on the first try—not as a patch  
- Delivered workshops and keynotes that make people laugh *and* rethink how they work

If you want design that works—for your business, your users, and your team—I’m your person.
