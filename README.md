# Angela Fowler | UX Strategy & Accessibility Portfolio

Welcome! I'm a product designer and strategist with a specialty in making accessibility practical, scalable, and profitable. I help teams build better tools—ones that actually work for everyone.

I bring deep experience in:
- Designing user flows that remove friction for real people
- Conducting accessibility audits and remediations
- Collaborating with engineers and product leads to solve complex UX challenges
- Making screen readers, keyboards, and interfaces play nicely together

If you're looking for clean strategy, systems thinking, and no fluff—you're in the right place.

## 👋 About Me

I’ve been blind all my life, so accessibility isn’t theory—it’s lived experience. But what makes me valuable on a team isn’t my identity. It’s my ability to cut through the noise, diagnose problems fast, and build systems that serve people—efficiently, ethically, and profitably.
