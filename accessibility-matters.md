# Why Accessibility Matters

Accessibility isn’t a bonus feature—it’s a fundamental part of good user experience.

Nearly **1 in 4 adults in the U.S. has a disability**. That’s a massive audience whose needs are often overlooked in digital design, hiring practices, and service delivery. But hereaccessibility improvements don’t just help disabled users. They benefit everyone.

## 🚀 Better Experience for All

Many of the changes I recommend—clear headings, keyboard-friendly navigation, readable fonts, flexible layouts—make life easier for *everyone*:
- Multitaskers with their hands full.
- People using older devices or slower connections.
- Folks navigating stress, fatigue, or cognitive overload.
- And yes, screen reader users like me.

Good accessibility = better usability.

## 💰 The Business Case

Ignoring accessibility isn't just a moral lapse—it’s a business risk.

- **$13 trillion** in annual disposable income is represented globally by people with disabilities and their families.
- **71%** of users with disabilities will leave a website that is difficult to use.
- **82%** of customers say they’d spend more money with companies that prioritize accessibility.

Accessibility isn’t charity. It’s smart business.

## ⚖️ The Legal Landscape

If all that weren’t enough, lawsuits are on the rise:
- **Over 4,600** digital accessibility lawsuits were filed in U.S. federal court in 2023 alone.
- Most of these suits involved small- to mid-sized businesses that didn’t realize they were noncompliant.

A proactive approach is cheaper—and less painful—than dealing with complaints or lawsuits later.

## 🧠 The Cultural Impact

Building access into your products, policies, and workplace culture sends a message:
> “You matter here.”

And in a competitive talent market, that's a message worth sending.
